##Accessibility Levels
After defining the 4 principles, WCAG defined 3 differents levels, the two first being absolutely required for any business and website. AAA level is recommended but not required as it may have bigger impacts on designs.

#Levels
Level A (required)
A: This level improves accessibility for most sites by making it easier for browsing readers to navigate a site and translate its content, but it is still pretty basic.

Level AA (required)
AA: This level makes content accessible to people with a wider range of disabilities by providing guidance on elements such as color contrast and error identification. Regulators prefer this level.

Level AAA (optional)
AAA: The highest level of accessibility compliance, this makes content accessible to the widest range of people, but it can significantly alter the design of a site. Government legislation doesn’t typically require this because it’s not always possible to conform.

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
ARIA is a specification from the W3C and created to improve accessibility of applications by providing extra information to assistive technologies, such as screen readers, via attributes which could be added to HTML.

Warning!

Use native HTML elements: Always use HTML elements whenever possible and try to not re-create element adding an ARIA role. Don’t use ARIA as a quick-fix.

A11y testing tools
When we talk about Web Accessibility Tools, we need to differentiate between automated tools and manual tools.

Based on Tenon.io insights, around 49% of tests are automated (using Axe, Lighthouse etc) and 55% are manual (Screen readers, code analysis etc).

Companies dedicated to A11y
Siteimprove, Tenon.io, Deque and The Paciello Group are amount the most famous company working with Web Accessibility.

Deque Systems
Deque developed an engine called axe-core, which is use by Lighthouse, a Web Accessibilty Testing tool, and webhint.

Example of accessibility tools inside Chrome Developer tools
On Chrome (and Firefox), you can find a color contrast checker available when you select an element to inspect.

You can also see the accessibility tree and all properties attached to an element in the right panel of the Google Developer tool.

Screen Readers
Few different screen readers exist. On Apple products, VoiceOver is the one usually used. Jaws is famous but expensive. NVDA is an open source version that is more an more used in replacement to the expensive Jaws windows software.

You can see in the graphic below that JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver were the most used late 2017.

How to enable VoiceOver on Mac OSX
Go to your preferences
Choose Accessibility
On the VoiceOver tab, choose to enable VoiceOver. I recommend to learn the shortcut ⌘ + F5 to easily enable / disable VoiceOver.
Basic shortcuts for VoiceOver (only on Mac OSX)
You can play to see how VoiceOver works. Here are some important shortcuts, like the Next heading that shows how important it is to have good headings.

VoiceOver ON/OFF: Command + F5 (Mac: ⌘ + Fn + F5)
Start reading: VO (⌘ + ⌥) + A
Stop reading: CTRL
Open rotor: VO (⌘ + ⌥) + U
Next heading: ⌘ + VO + H
Next link: ⌘ + VO + L
Next graphic: ⌘ + VO + G

Keyboard Navigation
Some people can’t use a mouse to navigate on webpages. It’s important to test your pages using only the keyboard (some people only use a switch button to navigate and do tasks on a device).

Keyboard Tabbing Order
If you tab to go throw all links in the article page, you will see that the aside comes after the link inside the content. That is not ideal but we will not change it in our example.

Skip Links
Links that facilitate navigation when the user is using the keyboard. It allows the user to go directly to the most important sections of the page.
